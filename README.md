# Adaptive Solar Panel System

## Description
A C++ controlled system that automatically tracks a light source using four photoresistors and two servo-driven axes of rotation. Built with an Arduino and breadboarded circuitry, the system continuously adjusts panel orientation to maximize light exposure. Custom CAD components were designed to mount the electronics and panel, and a phone flashlight was used to simulate a moving sun during testing. Solar panel voltage generated tested with multimeter.
